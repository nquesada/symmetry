UPDATE
======
The `symmetry` analyzer is now available in this [repo](https://github.com/MBI-Theory/symmetry).
This repo corresponds to an outdated version that was created only for archival purposes and is scheduled to be deleted.




This brute force symmetry analyzer used to be available at
[S. Patchkovskii's](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=ZfntG90AAAAJ) website http://www.cobalt.chem.ucalgary.ca/ps/symmetry/ which seems to be down.
Here you can find a copy of the file and a makefile with an example that you can run by typing `make example`.
The example will download a 13 atom Icosahedral Lennard-Jones cluster from the [Cambridge Cluster Database](http://www-wales.ch.cam.ac.uk/CCD.html), will format the file according to the input that `symmetry.out` takes and will run it to obtain the symmetry group of the cluster.
